                           Exception Handeling
                            -------------------

In any programming language there are 2 types of errors are possible.

1.Syntax Errors
2.Runtime Errors


Syntax Errors:-
--------------

The errors which occurs because of invalid syntax are called syntax errors.

ex:-

x = 10
if x == 10
    print("Hello")

  File "C:\Users\chand\PycharmProjects\testing_17_18_19_python\ExceptionHandeling\errors.py", line 4
    if x == 10
              ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Note:- Programmer is responsible to correct these syntax errors.Once all syntax errors are corrected then only program execution will be started.


Runtime Errors:-
---------------

we all are knows as Exceptions

While executing the program if something goes wrong because of end user input or output programming logic or memory problems etc then we will get Runtime Errors.

a = int(input("1st"))
b = int(input("2nd"))
print(a/b)
# a= 10
#b = 0

 File "C:\Users\chand\PycharmProjects\testing_17_18_19_python\ExceptionHandeling\errors.py", line 10, in <module>
    print(a/b)
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero


Note:- Exception Handeling concept applicable for runtime Errors but not for syntax errors.

What is Exception:-
-----------------

An unwanted and unexcepted event that distrubs normal flow of program is called  Exception.
ex:-

ZeroDivisionError
TypeError
ValueError
FileNotFoundError


It is highly recommended to handeling Exceptions.The main objective of exception handeling grecful Termination of the program.

Note:- Exception Handeling does not mean reparing exception.We have to define alternative way to continue rest of the program normally.

Default Exception Handing In python:-
------------------------------------

Every Exception in python is an object,For every exception type the corresponding classes are availaable.

a = int(input("1st"))
b = int(input("2nd"))
print(a/b)
# a= 10
#b = 0

 File "C:\Users\chand\PycharmProjects\testing_17_18_19_python\ExceptionHandeling\errors.py", line 10, in <module>
    print(a/b)
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

                           ------------------------


                                        BaseException

              |										   |           |

              Error                                    Error       Error
              |													   |
              Overflow                                             Permission
              Error                                                Error
              													   |
              													   TimeOut
              													   Error

Every Exception in Python is a class.

All exception classes are child classes of BaseException that is every exception class extends BaseExption either directly or indirectly.Hence BaseExption acts as root for Python Exception Hirechy.

Most of the time being a programmer we have to concentrate Exception and its child classes.


-----------

Customized Exception Handeling By using try-except
-------------------------------------------------

It is highly recommended to handel exceptions.

The code which may raise exception is called risky code and we have to take risky code inside try block.The corresponding handeling code we have to take inside except block.


syntax:-

try:
	Risky code

except NameOfException:
	Handeliing code/Alternative Code


without try-except
------------------

print("smnt-1")
print(10/0)
print("smnt-2")

Output:-

smnt-1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\chand\PycharmProjects\testing_17_18_19_python\ExceptionHandeling\errors.py", line 27, in <module>
    print(10/0)
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
--

a  = eval(input('Enter a number:-'))
b = eval(input('Enter your second number:-'))

try:
    div = a/b
    print(div)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print('Please do not divided by zero')
except TypeError:
    print('Please divied int with int')
